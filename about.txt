yves converter
===========================
yves conveter will take the manifest.yves file from any YouVersion bible from you .youversion/bibles directory on your android SD Card.

With newer versions of the bible app, all the files come in one directory with a `_version_` file that you need to rename to something with a YVES extension, like `bible.yves`.
